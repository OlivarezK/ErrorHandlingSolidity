# Error Hansling in Solidity

This Solidity program is a simple simulation of transactions such as depositing, withdrawing, and transfering funds to a wallet. It's purpose is to integrate error handling methods namely assert, require, and revert.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates how we could implement error handling methods into our transactions.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ErrorHandling.sol). Copy and paste the code from the "ErrorHandling.sol" file in this repository.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile ErrorHandling.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ErrorHandling" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by entering inputs and calling the variables or functions in the sidebar. You can interact with them by simply clicking the buttons with the variable names or with the "transact" button for functions. It is recommended to click on the dropdown icons to make it easier to enter inputs:

For functions that require an address as an input, you can copy one from the samples provided by Remix under the "ACCOUNT" dropdown which can be found in the left-hand sidebar as well:
